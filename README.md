# 👋 Hi, I'm Djon Biyemi

🎓 I'm a researcher exploring the rich intersections of **accounting**, **finance**, **automation**, and **mathematical logic** — with a deep academic interest in **tontine systems**, governance, and symbolic reasoning.

## 🔬 Research Interests
- **Tontine mechanisms** in African economies & international perspectives
- **Financial governance**, **auditing models**, and **accounting theory**
- **Document automation** and scripting with VBA, Batch, Python
- **Mathematical logic**, Gödel's theorems, and neuro-symbolic AI

## ⚙️ Projects & Goals
- Automating academic workflows and empirical data collection  
- Structuring large-scale literature reviews  
- Modeling hybrid systems combining finance + logic + automation  
- Supporting research in under-resourced contexts via simple tools

## 🌍 About Me
- 📍 Based in **Cameroon**  
- 🧠 Background: Master’s in **Accounting & Audit**  
- 🇷🇺 Currently learning **Russian** (Привет = Hello)  
- 🤝 Always open to **collaboration** or academic discussion

## 📌 Featured Work
Coming soon: empirical models of tontines, research automation tools, and exploratory frameworks for financial logic.
